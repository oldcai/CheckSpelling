## How to use it

**Select a word and press the shortcut.**

The first one will show you the word following Alfred’s `spell` keyword, so you’ll have a set of words to pick from for the substitution (to have it automatically switch the word in this case, you’ll need to set it up in Alfred’s preferences under `Features` → `Dictionary`). The following five will immediately replace the word with the best suggestion.
