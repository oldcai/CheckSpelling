CorrectSpelling checks and corrects spelling in various languages.

## Supported languages

| Code | Language |
|:-------:|:----------:|
| **en** | English |
| **de** | German |
| **es** | Spanish |
| **fr** | French |
| **pt** | Portuguese |
| **ru** | Russian |


## How to use it

**Select a word and press the shortcut.**

The first one will show you the word following Alfred’s `spell` keyword, so you’ll have a set of words to pick from for the substitution (to have it automatically switch the word in this case, you’ll need to set it up in Alfred’s preferences under `Features` → `Dictionary`). The following five will immediately replace the word with the best suggestion.

## Welcome to feedbacks

The performance on languages still differs, and I spent most time tuning the accuracy of English correction. However, I will keep improving the performance if there is feedback in the future.

Please open an issue if you met some difficulties or errors when using this workflow. Thank you.

## Special Thanks
