# Alfred CheckSpelling

This spelling correction plugin for Alfred is fixed and brought back in 2022-02-18, and is now maintained by @oldcai.

## What is CheckSpelling
CheckSpelling checks and corrects spelling in various languages. There are six configurable keyboard shortcuts, but you’ll typically need to setup only between one and three.

## Supported languages

| Code    | Language | Default Shortcut |
|:-------:|:----------:|:----------------:|
| **en**  | English | ⌥⌥ (Double press Option key)
| **de**  | German  | -
| **es**  | Spanish | -
| **fr**  | French  | -
| **pt**  | Portuguese | -
| **ru**  | Russian | -


## How to use it

**Select a word and press the shortcut.**

The first one will show you the word following Alfred’s `spell` keyword, so you’ll have a set of words to pick from for the substitution (to have it automatically switch the word in this case, you’ll need to set it up in Alfred’s preferences under `Features` → `Dictionary`). The following five will immediately replace the word with the best suggestion.
